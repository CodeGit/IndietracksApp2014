It was so fun that they decided to start a band. That summer they put together their first songs and thought about incorporating a drummer. Even though they couldn't find one, they decided to start recording all the same. There was a very small room at Nicolas's and after taking what they had to it (a portaestudio, one computer, a microphone, an amp, guitars, a fan and a cassette player), they decided to name it \"Momia Studio\". In 2010 and 2011 they moved in together and recorded many songs, which reflect the spirit of the first rehearsals: simple, raw and fun. One day they went to a rehearsal space and recorded the sounds of a drum, which they then used to complete most of the songs, and so by the end of 2011 they had finished Our First Album and FAT (which despite the name came before OFA). Then they made the first copies on cassette and Nicolas made a website for downloading the albums with their past projects and friends. In this way Fariscal Records was born.\nOne stage had finished and they really wanted to play live shows. This time they would find a drummer yes or yes.\nAfter a few weeks, they met Marta and from the first practice the three knew they had to keep playing together, so the search was over.\nAnd so a new phase of getting \"out of the house\" and playing live shows started.\nAt the second concert they played in an old video store in Boedo and among the public was Bruno, an unknown fella at the time who invited them to play at the 1234 Shoreditch Festival in London, where he worked. From that point they started to build their 2012 European tour where they met new friends and recorded (in London) the songs that would be part of their third album out in early 2013. The sound of Los Cripis is simple and primitive, no pedals or effects, but full of saturation, melodies, freshness, d.i.y. spirit and color. First takes predominate in the recordings, perhaps reminding us of The Shaggss or Beat Happening..."
